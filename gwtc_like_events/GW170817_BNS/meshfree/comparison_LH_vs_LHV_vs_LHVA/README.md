## NOTE:

1) Here the ```plotting_utils.py``` is an updated version where one can create corner-plots with 3 different datasets. In our case these are posterior samples corresponding to L1H1, L1H1V1 and L1H1V1A1 networks.

2) We also present a skymap with the 90% credible localization uncertainty for the above mentioned detector networks.
