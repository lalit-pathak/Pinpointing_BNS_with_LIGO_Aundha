# Run GW170817-like event using meshfree PE


## Here are the instructions to run the PE:

1. Set the number of CPUs to be used in `run.py`.
2. Start PE by running `python3 run.py` on terminal.
3. Posterior samples are stored in the `post_samples` directory.
4. Enter `plots` directory and generate the corner plots in `corner_plots_TaylorF2.ipynb` notebook. 
5. On running the `run.py` file, posterior samples for different noise realizations shall be created.
